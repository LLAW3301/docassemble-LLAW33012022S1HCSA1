  **Definition of Threats of Violence:**
  
  A threat is any communication indicating an intention to cause harm. Threats of   violence can be both direct or indirect and are partially words and partially     conduct (1). 
  
  Threats of violence could be through the form of:
  
  * Written
  * Spoken
  * By conduct

  Examples of threats of violence could include:
  
  * “*I want to kill you*”
  * “*I will break your arm*”
  * “*Watch your back*”
  * “*You don’t want to mess with me*”
  
  *Note;* Threats of violence, like the examples given above, clearly show intent   to cause harm. There is a difference between showing intent and expressing       emotion. For example; “*I feel like I could kill you*” could potentially be       interpreted as an expression of emotion.
