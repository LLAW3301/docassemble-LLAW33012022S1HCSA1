  It is very important for a victim of rape or sexual assault to be medically examined as soon as possible after the assault for the following reasons:

  1.  To determine if there has been any injury, especially internal, that may not be readily apparent

  2. To test for a sexually transmitted disease and/or unwanted pregnancy

  3. To collect medical evidence for possible prosecution.
