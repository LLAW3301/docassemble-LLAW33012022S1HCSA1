question: Welcome
subquestion: |

  Welcome to the COVID-19 vaccine eligibility application.
  
  This app asks you some questions about a patient and whether they are willing to conset to the vaxzevria vaccine. This app asks for the name of the patient, and their age.
  
  This app then asks if they have been consulted on the risks of the Vaxevria. If they have not , the app will exit. If they have the app will ask if they consent to the Vaxzevria vaccine. If the patient is over 60, they are getting the Vaxzevria, regardless of whether they consent or not.
  
  This app then prints out the patient's response, along with the responses of a number of existing patients.
  
  **disclaimer:** This app does not offer legal and/or medical advice
